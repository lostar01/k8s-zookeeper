# k8s-zookeeper: zookeeper cluster of DRAFT on Kubernetes
##### Steps:
* Build docker image via Quay.io
* Create kubernetes pods & services

        kubectl create -f zookeeper.yaml [--namespace=xxx]
* Teardown

        ./teardown.sh [--namespace=xxx]

-----
##### Notes:
* Enable zookeeper cluster nodes' intra communication via 3 services (1 service for 1 pod: zookeeper-1, zookeeper-2, and zookeeper-3)
* Use "zookeeper" service as a load balancer for clients. It doesn't matter on which zookeeper pod the clients are connected in a zookeeper cluster.
* Since pod name (== hostname), which is generated by k8s replication controller, won't be fixed, we use "service" name (e.g. zookeeper-1, zookeeper-2, zookeeper-3) rather than hostname in zoo.cfg.   
* Originally, we use an additional zookeeper service for load balancing client communications (port 2181). But after experimented with spark master HA, it seems not work correctly. Therefore, we won't simplify/abstract with an additional layer for zookeeper client communications.  
* Resilience verified OK: 
        
        (1) follower crash: container (docker kill), pod (kubectl delete pods), vm (reboot) 
        (2) leader crash: container (docker kill), pod (kubectl delete pods), vm (reboot)
* Cluster isolation verified OK:
 
        (1) namespaces under the same user context 
            [current-context: default]
            kubectl create -f zookeeper.yaml --namespace=default
            kubectl create -f zookeeper.yaml --namespace=staging
        (2) namespaces under different user context 
            kubectl config use-context develop
            [current-context: develop]
            kubectl create -f zookeeper.yaml --namespace=develop
        Fully isolated among above 3 namespaces

##### TODO:
* Kubernetes 1.0.x doesn't support emptyDir volumes for containers running as non-root (it's commit in master branch, not v1.0.0 branch, refer to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/9384 & https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/12627). Use root rather than zookeeper user instead at this moment. (Done: It's verified OK in kubernetes 1.1.1 in using zookeeper user instead of root)
* Try to spread zookeeper pods (created by different replication controllers, but using same service for external clients) on different nodes by experimenting kube-scheduler.service with policy configuration.
